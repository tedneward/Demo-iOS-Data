# Demo-iOS-Data
A collection of demos around doing data on iOS

## FileDemo
Showing how to use the FileManager to obtain the path, and then the built-in functions of (for example) String/NSString to read/write to a file.

## PrefsDemo
Showing how to use the Settings class to get/set "user settings", which in turn are made visible in the standard Settings app.

## SerializationDemo
Showing how to use the Archiver/KeyedArchiver classes to serialize objects/data to a file.

## SQLiteDemo
Shows how to use the "raw" SQLite3 C-based API to access a SQLite database on the iOS device. Note that there are many Swift-based libraries to make this easier, but this is the foundation that all of them will use under the hood.
